# Markdown Syntax Examples

This document provides examples of common Markdown syntax that you can use in your README.md files.

First though, presuming you are editing/updating your README.md/other markdown .md files on "in place" directly on your GitHub (if you're not I highly recommend this), if you haven't already, try playing with the "edit" and "preview" buttons in the upper left. 

I.E. these ones:

These will only be available for you on your own repositories, but they are very useful for learning/editing markdown (.md files) syntax. 

When you press the "code" button, it shows the underlying markdown code as currently written.

When you press the "preview" button, it shows how that markdown code will render on the webpage.

This is super useful to play with if you're wondering if you did something correctly/want to double check before committing changes after editing.

## üß© Code Snippets

Use backticks for inline code:

Use triple backticks for blocks:

plot(data.x, data.y);

Specify the language (`matlab`, `bash`, `python`, etc.) after the opening triple backticks to enable syntax highlighting.
